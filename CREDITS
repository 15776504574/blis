The BLIS framework was primarily authored by

  Field Van Zee               (The University of Texas at Austin)

but many others contributed input and feedback as it was initially
conceived, designed, and developed, including:

  John Gunnels                (IBM, T.J. Watson Research Center)
  Jeff Hammond                (Argonne National Laboratory)
  Francisco Igual             (Universidad Complutense de Madrid)
  Lee Killough                (Appro International)
  Tze Meng Low                (The University of Texas at Austin)
  Bryan Marker                (The University of Texas at Austin)
  Rhys Ulerich                (The University of Texas at Austin)
  Robert van de Geijn         (The University of Texas at Austin)

Thanks go the following individuals for porting very early versions
of BLIS to new architectures as proofs-of-concept:

  Francisco Igual             (The University of Texas at Austin)
  Tyler Smith                 (The University of Texas at Austin)

BLIS's development was partially funded by grants from Microsoft and
the National Science Foundation (Awards CCF-0917167 and OCI-1148125).
