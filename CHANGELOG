    Added debug statements to bl2_mm_acquire_m().
    
    Details:
    - Added printf() statements to bl2_mm_acquire_m() to help debug issues
      with prematurely exhausted memory pool.
    - Removed 'd' from kernel names of reference kernels in clarksville
      configuration's bl2_kernel.h

    Defined Frobenius norm operations.
    
    Details:
    - Added level-0 grabis macro operation to grab imaginary component of one
      variable and copy it to the real component of another variable.
    - Defined sumsqv operation, which computes the sum of the absolute squares
      of the elements of a vector. This implementation is modeled after ?lassq
      in netlib LAPACK.
    - Defined fnormv and fnormm operations, which compute the Frobenius norm on
      vectors and matrices, respectively. These operations are treated as one-
      operand operations where the output norm value is the real projection of
      the datatype of the input operand. Both operations are implemented in terms
      of sumsqv.

    Added GENT*R macros; tweaked bl2_machval defs.
    
    Details:
    - Added function and prototype macro-generating macros for GENTFUNCR and
      GENTPROTR, which are one-operand macros with auxiliary real projection
      types.
    - Tweaked bl2_machval files to use new macros.

    Fixed harmless macro bug in level-1m operations.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed some inconsistent usage of n_iter_max and n_iter in the two
      bl2_set_dims_incs_uplo_[12]m macros. The right thing ended up happening
      despite the bug, which is why I had not discovered it until now.

    Renamed x86,x86_64 kernels to indicate 'd' fusing.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed x86 and x86_64 kernels to contain a 'd' before the fusing shape
      to emphasize that the fusing shape is not for all datatype instances, but
      rather just for one (that of double-precision real). Other fusing shapes
      would be proportional to their precision and domain "byte footprints".
    - Corresponding changes to config/clarksville/bl2_kernel.h.

    More tweaks to _config.h, _kernel.h; smem tweaks.
    
    Details:
    - Moved kernel-related definitions form bl2_config.h to bl2_kernel.h.
    - Replaced #define of _GNU_SOURCE with #define of _POSIX_C_SOURCE. This
      accomplishes the same thing (enabling posix_memalign()) without enabling
      all of the GNU extensions we don't need.
    - Defined the size of the static memory pool in terms of MC, KC, and NC,
      as well as two new constants that determine how many MCxKC blocks and
      how many KCxNC blocks should be allocated (defined in bl2_config.h).
    - In the case of static memory pool exhaustion, replaced the generic
      bl2_abort() with a specific error code call.

      clarksville configurations.
    - Updated CREDITS, INSTALL, LICENSE, README files.

    Fixed bug in reference gemm ukernels.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug whereby, for the reference gemm ukernels, the matrix product
      was not correctly accumulated and scaled (by alpha) into the output matrix
      C. (Thanks to Fran for finding this bug.)
    - Whitespace changes to reference trsm kernels.

    Expanded reference packm/unpackm kernel set to 16.
    
    Details:
    - Added 10xk, 12xk, 14xk, and 16xk reference kernels for packm and
      unpackm.
    - Updated bl2_[un]packm_cxk() to silently use scal2m if "out of range"
      kernel size is requested. (Thanks to Tyler for finding this bug.)
    - Updated bl2_kernel.h to contain new _KERNEL definitions, according
      to above changes, for 'reference' and 'clarksville' configurations.
    - Updated CHANGELOG.
    - Removed "output*.m" from .gitignore.

    - Other trivial changes.

    Added auto-detection of version string (via git).
    
    Details:
    - Added build/update-version-file.sh script for auto-detecting "version"
      string and updating 'version' file accordingly. (If .git directory is
      not present, then it is assumed this copy of BLIS is a downloaded
      release, in which case 'version' file is left unchanged.)
    - Added invocation of update-version-file.sh to configure script.
