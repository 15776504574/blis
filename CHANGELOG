    Added unified test suite, and many fixes.
    
    Details:
    - Added a highly configurable, unified test suite.
    
    - Removed DUPB configuration constant from bl2_kernel.h and macro-kernel
      header files. Now, instead, DUPB is computed as (NDUP != 1) within each
      macro-kernel. This fixes a bug in trmm/trsm whereby bp was indexed into
      incorrectly when DUPB was set to FALSE but the NDUP was still non-unit.
      By encoding both pieces of information into one constant in _kernel.h,
      it seems somewhat less likely others will encounter this bug in the
      future.
    - Added level-2 cache blocksizes to _kernel.h for reference configuration,
      and defined blocksizes in _cntl.c files to these default values.
    
    - Changed semantics of her2k and syr2k such that these operations no longer
      expect the B matrix to already be conjugate-transposed (or just transposed
      for syr2k). However, these semantics are preserved for the internal
      mechanics of the implementations, including the internal back-end and all
      blocked variants.
    - Inserted checks for real-valued alpha and beta for herk/her2k and herk,
      respectively.
    
    - Relaxed general object structure constraints in _basic_check() for gemv, ger.
    - Changed her front-end to NOT copy-cast to real projection; instead, this is
      replaced by selecting either the real part or both parts within the unblocked
      algorithm implementation, depending on the value of conjh.
    - Added conjh to all _check routines for her so that the code knows when to
      verify that alpha has an imaginary component equal to zero (for her, but
      not syr).
    - Changed control tree for her to forgo packing.
    
    - Added unit diagonal support to fnormm.
    - Redefined real versions of abval2s macros in terms of fabs(), fabsf().
    - Redefined complex versions of sqrt2s macros using the actual "complex square
      root" formula.
    - Created new level-0 object-based routines, suffixed with "sc" (for "scalar").
    - Defined new level-1v, -1d, and -1m versions of add and sub operations
      (two-operand add and subtract).
    - Added new scalar macros:
      - getris: acquire real and imaginary components.
      - setris: set real and imaginary components.
      - addjs: addition with conjugated x.
      - subjs: subtraction with conjugated x.
    - Defined new utility operations:
      - absumv: element-wise sum of absolute values for vector elements.
      - absumm: element-wise sum of absolute values for matrix elements.
      - mkherm: convert existing matrix to Hermitian.
      - mksymm: convert existing matrix to symmetric.
      - mktrim: convert existing matrix to triangular.
    
    - Added various error checking routines.
    - Added bl2_clock_min_diff(), which is used to more cleanly measure the
      wall clock time of a code block.
    - Added general stride support to bl2_obj_alloc_buffer().
    - Added bl2_obj_init_scalar().
    - Updated parameter mapping in bl2_param_map.c.
    - Added support for queriable version string.
    
    - Fixed a bug in the her2k macro-kernels (which currently are simply
      implemented in terms of two invocations of herk) whereby beta was being
      applied to both the first and second rank-k updates, rather than only
      the first.
    - Fixed a bug in trmm/trsm whereby transpose and right side cases were not
      properly implemented due to erroneous assumptions regarding aliasing and
      root objects.
    - Fixed a bug in the upper triangular trsm macro-kernel in which the wrong
      MR x NR block of B was being updated.
    - Fixed a bug in the inverts macro in the double real case whereby the
      value was typecast to float before inversion. This affected non-unit cases
      of dtrsm.
    - Fixed a bug in the reference kernels for gemmtrsm whereby the minus one
      constant was being applied incorrectly.
    - Fixed a bug in the overall treatment of non-unit alpha for trsm. The code
      now mimics the rank-k strategy of gemm, whereby alpah is applied during
      the first iteration of variant 3, with BLIS_ONE passed in instead for
      subsequent iterations. This also required passing alpha into the macro-
      kernels as well as the fused gemmtrsm micro-kernels.
    - Fixed a bug in trsm_u_blk_var1 whereby the gemm macro-kernel was being
      called for blocks strictly above the diagonal. While this sounds good in
      theory, this cannot be done because gemm_ker_var2 expects row panels of
      A to be packed from top to bottom, while for trsm_u, A is actually packed
      from bottom to top due to the reverse (BR->TL) nature of the algorithm.
    - Fixed a bug in packm_cxk() whereby panel packings with unit panel
      dimensions were mishandled due to incorrect arguments to the copyv kernel.
      Also changed the copyv kernel invocation to scal2v so that these edge
      cases are properly handled when scaling is requested.
    - Fixed a bug in packv_int() whereby an uninitialized object is passed in
      instead of the source object.
    - Fixed a bug whereby level-2 code could allocate memory dynamically via
      bl2_malloc() and then attempt to free it via bl2_mm_release(). Also fixed
      a potential future bug whereby a mem_t object that is actually no longer
      "allocated" from the static pool is mistaken for being allocated due to
      failure to NULLify the buffer when the block was most recently released.
    - Fixed a bug in bl2_acquire_mpart_*() whreby the uplo field was mistakenly
      toggled when the requested subpartition needed to be "reflected" due to it
      residing in an unstored region.

    Added debug statements to bl2_mm_acquire_m().
    
    Details:
    - Added printf() statements to bl2_mm_acquire_m() to help debug issues
      with prematurely exhausted memory pool.
    - Removed 'd' from kernel names of reference kernels in clarksville
      configuration's bl2_kernel.h

    Defined Frobenius norm operations.
    
    Details:
    - Added level-0 grabis macro operation to grab imaginary component of one
      variable and copy it to the real component of another variable.
    - Defined sumsqv operation, which computes the sum of the absolute squares
      of the elements of a vector. This implementation is modeled after ?lassq
      in netlib LAPACK.
    - Defined fnormv and fnormm operations, which compute the Frobenius norm on
      vectors and matrices, respectively. These operations are treated as one-
      operand operations where the output norm value is the real projection of
      the datatype of the input operand. Both operations are implemented in terms
      of sumsqv.

    Added GENT*R macros; tweaked bl2_machval defs.
    
    Details:
    - Added function and prototype macro-generating macros for GENTFUNCR and
      GENTPROTR, which are one-operand macros with auxiliary real projection
      types.
    - Tweaked bl2_machval files to use new macros.

    Fixed harmless macro bug in level-1m operations.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed some inconsistent usage of n_iter_max and n_iter in the two
      bl2_set_dims_incs_uplo_[12]m macros. The right thing ended up happening
      despite the bug, which is why I had not discovered it until now.

    Renamed x86,x86_64 kernels to indicate 'd' fusing.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed x86 and x86_64 kernels to contain a 'd' before the fusing shape
      to emphasize that the fusing shape is not for all datatype instances, but
      rather just for one (that of double-precision real). Other fusing shapes
      would be proportional to their precision and domain "byte footprints".
    - Corresponding changes to config/clarksville/bl2_kernel.h.

    More tweaks to _config.h, _kernel.h; smem tweaks.
    
    Details:
    - Moved kernel-related definitions form bl2_config.h to bl2_kernel.h.
    - Replaced #define of _GNU_SOURCE with #define of _POSIX_C_SOURCE. This
      accomplishes the same thing (enabling posix_memalign()) without enabling
      all of the GNU extensions we don't need.
    - Defined the size of the static memory pool in terms of MC, KC, and NC,
      as well as two new constants that determine how many MCxKC blocks and
      how many KCxNC blocks should be allocated (defined in bl2_config.h).
    - In the case of static memory pool exhaustion, replaced the generic
      bl2_abort() with a specific error code call.

    Expanded reference packm/unpackm kernel set to 16.
    
    Details:
    - Added 10xk, 12xk, 14xk, and 16xk reference kernels for packm and
      unpackm.
    - Updated bl2_[un]packm_cxk() to silently use scal2m if "out of range"

      to above changes, for 'reference' and 'clarksville' configurations.
    - Updated CHANGELOG.
    - Removed "output*.m" from .gitignore.

    Added auto-detection of version string (via git).
    
    Details:
    - Added build/update-version-file.sh script for auto-detecting "version"
      string and updating 'version' file accordingly. (If .git directory is
      not present, then it is assumed this copy of BLIS is a downloaded
      release, in which case 'version' file is left unchanged.)
    - Added invocation of update-version-file.sh to configure script.
