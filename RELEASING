Here are the steps to follow to create a new release (version) of BLIS:

1. Make sure there are no commits that have yet to be pulled into
   local repository.

   $ git pull

   If there are any commits upstream, merge them as appropriate.

2. Verify that the code builds properly.

   $ ./configure auto; make

3. Verify that the code passes BLIS and BLAS tests:

   $ make check

4. Bump the version number:

   $ ./build/bump-version "0.3.2"

5. Push the new commits and new tag associated with the new version:

   $ git push
   $ git push --tag

6. Draft and send a new announcement to blis-devel.

7. Update ReleaseNotes wiki with body of announcement.
